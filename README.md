<h1>Medical Appointment Booking website</h1>

<p>This is the Capstone Project of the IBM Front-End Developer course by IBM on Coursera.</p>

<h3>Scenario Overview</h3>
<p>StayHealthy Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving healthcare facilities in remote areas with minimal to no medical facilities or resources. The Executive Director has started the Go digital initiative as part of StayHealthy's broader vision to maximize reach. One aspect of the initiative is building a website to help patients access doctors anytime, anywhere.</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>StayHealthy conducted an extensive survey to assess the medical facilities available in remote areas and found that several patients have a tough time finding the right doctor at the right time. There are usually no doctors or hospitals within a 50-mile radius, or the wait time to meet a doctor is too long. Many times, this has resulted in life-threatening emergencies or lost lives.
With the internet and broadband availability increasing in remote areas, the initiative from StayHealthy will help get patients access to general physicians and specialists at the right time easily.</p>

<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
<p>A user-friendly, intuitive, and accessible platform that helps connect patients with doctors and specialists for consultations and medical prescriptions.</p>
